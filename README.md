# Dungeons_and_Dragons
In this assignment I implemented a single-player multi-level version of a Dungeons and Dragons board game.
In the game, you're trapped in a dungeon, surrounded by enemies. Your goal is to fight your way through them and get to the next level of the dungeon. 
Once you complete all the levels, you win the game.

This assignment is coded in Java, using OOP principles.
